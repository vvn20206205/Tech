    As organizations increasingly transition critical operations to the cloud, ensuring strong security measures becomes paramount. However, the evolving threat landscape poses significant challenges as cyber adversaries continually devise sophisticated tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure. This article gives an overview of cloud computing infrastructure, how cloud computing works, as well as how major companies around the world implement cloud computing transformation. The article also provides in-depth analysis of the current threats facing cloud security, from data breaches and insider threats to sophisticated attacks and vulnerabilities in the supply chain. By examining real-world case studies and industry reports, we identify key vulnerabilities that leave cloud environments at risk of exploitation. Furthermore, this article includes the security options offered by the major vendors, thereby exploring the emerging trends and technologies that are shaping the future of cloud security. Additionally, we discuss the role of automation, orchestration, and artificial intelligence in enhancing threat detection and response in the cloud. By fostering collaboration among industry stakeholders and leveraging innovative approaches, organizations can proactively mitigate risk and build resilient cloud architectures to the challenges of the future threat landscape.
